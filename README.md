# Comfortaa

Comfortaa is a rounded geometric sans-serif type design intended for large sizes. It is absolutely free, both for personal and commercial use.

If you like it please visit my DeviantArt page and fav it (but obviously only if you like it.) You are also more than welcome to comment about anything you want (I'm open to critique). I obviously would love to see how my font is being used, so feel free to comment with a link to your work, or send me a message.

I hope you will enjoy using my font!

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you particularly want to build fonts manually on your own computer, you will need to install the [`yq` utility](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq). On OS X with Homebrew, type `brew install yq`; on Linux, try `snap install yq`; if all else fails, try the instructions on the linked page.

Then:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.
